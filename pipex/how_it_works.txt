	parse arguments - acces to infile
	find command #1
		
	if not found -
		free everything and exit (with proper number of error)
	if found - 
	(i haven't freed 2 vars - short cmd and correct ppth_line)
		create a child process "fork()"	
		redirect the stdout/stdin "dup2()"
		close and free everything
		execute the command "execve()"

		
	
	close fd-s in child process
	same command 2
	close fd-s in parent process
	wait command (2, 1)


	*** for bonus ***
		create while loop which i'll call from main function
		if this loop:
			find_command()
			execute_cmd() with a counter!
				because of this counter i'll be able to execute mny commands
				and manage in wich cmd dup2(fd[1], stdout) or dup2(fd[0], stdin)
				i guess 
		create a child process "fork()"	
		redirect the stdout/stdin "dup2()"
